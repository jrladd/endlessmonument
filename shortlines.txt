But joyed in theyr prayse.
Your dolefull dreriment.
So Orpheus did for his owne bride,
My truest turtle dove
In theyr fresh garments trim.
And whylest she doth her dight,
Another gay girland
To deck the bridale bowers.
For she will waken strayt,
Where none doo fishes take.
No blemish she may spie.
Be also present heere,
And carroll of loves praise.
To this dayes merriment.
The deawy leaves among.
Helpe quickly her to dight,
Doe make and still repayre.
Some graces to be seene,
Fit for so joyfull day,
Her beauty to disgrace.
Let all the rest be thine.
When they their tymbrels smyte,
As if it were one voyce.
And loud advaunce her laud,
Some angell she had beene.
Seeme lyke some mayden Queene,
So farre from being proud.
Her forehead yvory white,
Her paps lyke lyllies budded,
Upon her so to gaze,
Medusaes mazeful hed.
And giveth lawes alone.
And unrevealed pleasures,
That commeth in to you,
To humble your proud faces
The whiles with hollow throates.
Like crimsin dyde in grayne,
The more they on it stare.
The pledge of all our band,
Whom heaven would heape with blis.
Poure out to all that wull,
For they can doo it best:
With Barnaby the bright,
And bonefiers make all day,
Within the Westerne fome:
Appeare out of the East.
As joying in the sight
And in her bed her lay;
In proud humility;
And leave my love alone,
that no man may us see,
the safety of our joy:
And begot Majesty.
Make sudden sad affrights;
Fray us with things that be not.
Make us to wish theyr choking.
Like divers fethered doves,
Conceald through covert night.
For it will soone be day:
My love with me to spy:
His pleasures with thee wrought.
That may our comfort breed:
Of women in their smart,
Without blemish or staine,
Grant that it may so be.
More then we men can fayne,
With lasting happinesse,
But promist both to recompens,
